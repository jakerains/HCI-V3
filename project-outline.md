# Naval Ship's Helm Command Interface

## Purpose
A voice-activated helm command interface that allows natural communication with a ship's helm system. The interface responds to voice commands with naval-style acknowledgments, providing an intuitive and hands-free way to issue helm commands.

## Functional Overview

### Voice Command System
- Activates when the wake word "helm" is detected
- Processes natural language commands for ship control
- Provides immediate audio feedback in naval command style
- Displays visual confirmation of commands and responses

### Command Categories
- **Rudder Control**
  - Direction: left/right
  - Angle specifications
  - Standard naval rudder commands
  - Examples: "helm left 15 degrees rudder", "helm standard rudder"

- **Course Changes**
  - Specific headings (0-359 degrees)
  - Cardinal directions
  - Course corrections
  - Examples: "helm steady course 180", "helm come to north"

- **Speed Control**
  - Forward/reverse operations
  - Standard naval speed commands
  - Examples: "helm all ahead full", "helm all stop"

### User Experience
- Simple, focused interface showing current command status
- Real-time voice feedback with "Helm, aye" acknowledgments
- Visual confirmation of recognized commands
- Immediate audio response playback
